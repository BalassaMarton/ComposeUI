ComposeUI is a dotnet core based, WebView2 using UI Container for hybrid web-desktop applications.
Our goal is to fill the feature gaps with respect to UI components, layout management,
and subpar native hosting in other industry container solutions by providing a standard
container as an open desktop platform. It is a hybrid solution that meets the needs of 
a diverse application catalog as well as a compelling opensource alternative.
